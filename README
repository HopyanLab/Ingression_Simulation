Ingression Simulation

Requires Surface Evolver v2.70 available at https://kenbrakke.com/evolver/evolver.html as well as the python packages listed in requirements.txt.

The script "run_sim.py" runs a set of simulations using multiprocessing to call multiple instances of Surface Evolver.

The scrypt "analyse_output.py" processes the data generated by the simulations and creates a plot.
